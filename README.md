We have a dataset of 200 reviews of people who visited a certain restaurant.The reviews of all the people are one line reviews.
After pre-processing the dataset and applying Naive_Bayes classifier we get the result in the form of "0" or "1",where 0 is the output if the review is bad and "1" if the review is good.

Using sklearn library  cross_validation,Naive_Bayes classifier, GaussianNB have been implemented for this particular NLP problem.

Confusion Matrix-
The problem also contains confusion matrix which helps to calculate the accuracy of the above NLP problem.


Use the attached CSV file as a dataset.As part of data_processing the .csv file has been converted to .tsv file.
